MojangAccountsPython
====================

A Python 3 reimplementation of the [mojang accounts client](https://github.com/Mojang/AccountsClient/).
Its main use at the moment is to convert usernames of mojang accounts into their respective UUIDs.

I hope this makes your scripting life easier and your server maintenance woes lesser.
